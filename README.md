## Technologies
This project was built using React.js, Typescript, and Antd.

## Deliverable

1. How long did you spend on this project?
 - I dedicated approximately 7 hours to complete this project.

2. What difficulties did you run into?
 - One of the main difficulties I encountered was implementing the highlighting feature when the user clicks on the "Approve Samples" button. Initially, I attempted to use the Checkbox component from Antd design, but it didn't provide the desired functionality. However, I was able to overcome this challenge by utilizing the CheckboxGroup component instead.
 
3. If you had more time, what else would you have considered adding to your dashboard?
 - Given more time, I would have focused on enhancing the visual appeal and user-friendliness of the dashboard. This would involve incorporating additional styling elements to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.
